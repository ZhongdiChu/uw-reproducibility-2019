# Boost Your Research Reproducibility with Binder

In this folder you can find the materials you need to take part in a Turing Way developed workshop to help researchers share their research in a reproducible way using Binder.

# Agenda for the day

* 9.00 - 9.15: Registration, coffee and introductions
* 9.15 - 10.00: Why you need a reproducible computing environment and how Binder can help
* 10.00 - 10.45: Zero to Binder, a guided tour of building a Binder resource
* 10.45 - 11.30: Build your own Binder
* 11.30 - noon: Demonstrating your Binder, general questions, feedback and close

# Repository contents

* [Paired examples](paired_examples.md) exercise
* A folder of [workshop presentations](workshop-presentations) (some in `md` format, others in `pptx` and `pdf` where available, only `pdfs` linked below)
  * [Reproducible computational environments](workshop-presentations/ReproducibleComputationalEnvironment.pdf) for Manchester and London workshops by [Kirstie Whitaker](https://github.com/KirstieJane).
  * [Zero to Binder code-along](workshop-presentations/zero-to-binder.md) for Manchester and London workshops by [Sarah Gibson](https://github.com/sgibson91) building heavily off [Tim Head's](https://github.com/betatim) [Build a Binder](https://build-a-binder.github.io/) workshop materials.
* [Communications](before_workshop.md) and [Workshop advert](workshop_advert.md) to send out before the workshop.
  * These are specific to the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019, but can easily be adapted.
* [Feedback form](feedback_form.md) that you can make into a google form
  * Such as [this one](https://goo.gl/forms/DZGFMPJ4EPClc4qK2) for the Manchester and London workshops in March 2019.
